Create a new HTML file, index.html. 
This file should contain a header element with your name 
and a list element with (hyper)links to each of your finished assessments from the above tutorials. 
Make sure all of your work from the tutorials is included in the Repo 
- therefore is also available on the GitHub Pages site for your repo. 

Once completed, submit to Canvas the link to your GitHub Pages site.
